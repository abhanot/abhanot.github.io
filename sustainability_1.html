                                Seventeen of the 18 warmest years recorded since 1880 occurred after the year 2000 (Figure 1). As our planet continues to heat, concerns regarding the environmental impacts of rising temperatures across the globe are becoming increasingly critical. In early 2018, temperatures in the North Pole were recorded as reaching 30 degrees above normal temperatures. Ice in the Arctic is melting at a staggering rate, and scientists are are concerned about how this will affect coastal and low-lying flat areas. The melting of permafrost is releasing greenhouse gases that are expected to accelerate global warming, further intensifying its impact on ecosystems and the environment. Modern society as we know it is about to change.

                            <h1>What is Permafrost</h1>
                        <p>
                                Permafrost refers to frozen soil and water that covers nearly a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere (Figure 2). In regions such as Alaska and Siberia, permafrost is the very ground that maintains structure and upholds transportation routes. 
                                <br><br>
                                Permafrost contains the remnants of dead plants and animals that have been frozen for thousands of years. Similar to any preserved organic matter, everything that’s frozen deep inside permafrost is protected by the ice that preserves it. Once the ice thaws, the organic matter becomes exposed to microbes that facilitate its decomposition. The damage could be quite substantial as the decay of such a large amount of matter can pump waste products such as methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These waste products may become stored in the atmosphere, further accelerating climate change.

                        <h1>Why Have Memes Become Relevant in Politics? </h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            People are consuming more and more information online, particularly with respect to news. A recent report finds that 59% of Canadians get their news online through social media. News agencies are also recognizing this shift and are focusing their efforts to expanding their presence on social media platforms. 
                            <br><br>
                            The increasingly popular trend of obtaining news online comes with the consequence of having to combat fake news (false and inaccurate news that has been intentionally fabricated). The 2016 US Presidential Election marked the first instance in which fake news spread rampantly online and had huge implications. Memes were heavily circulated online during the election; they propagated ideological viewpoints that targeted candidates, parties, or policies on numerous platforms. Their messages ultimately impacted how people perceived the big issues surrounding the election .
                            <br><br>
                            Dr. Bousfield argues that platforms matter with respect to the circulation of memes. He states that, “Memes on Facebook can get very toxic because of the private groups and specific, primarily white, audiences they are targeting.” Conversely, memes on platforms like Twitter, which do not have private or hidden groups, are “a lot more open and these memes are subject to greater backlash”. The privacy of hidden Facebook groups provides an opportunity for meme-creators to present radical ideologies exclusively to targeted, like-minded consumers who are most likely to accept them. On platforms that don’t allow users to form large private groups, every meme can be subjected to public scrutiny, and socially unacceptable content is more likely to face backlash that stops it from circulating. Facebook permits toxic political memes to circulate more widely and with less backlash. When political memes appear online, many interpret their meaning as humorous or random but in actuality, they are designed for a specific purpose.

                        <h1>The Carbon Problem</h1>
                        <p>     
                                The potential release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by melting permafrost is a well-known phenomenon. According to Kevin Schaefer, a scientist from National Snow & Ice Data Center, the Earth’s atmosphere contains around 850 gigatons of carbon dioxide, while there are about 1400 gigatons of carbon frozen in permafrost. The release of such an astronomical amount of carbon from melting permafrost would nearly triple the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, which could accelerate the rate of global warming to unparalleled, and possibly unrecoverable, levels.
                                <br><br>
                                Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can trap the Earth’s ecosystem into a viscous heating cycle known as a warming feedback loop. Essentially, greenhouse gas-emissions cause temperatures to rise. Rising temperatures melt permafrost, which in turn releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, further increasing global temperatures and paving the way towards a never-ending cycle. Scientists suspect that once a certain temperature threshold is breached, the cycle will spiral out of control; however, it is unclear what this temperature may be. For this reason, permafrost has been labelled as the “the sleeping giant” of climate change and is a major threat to our ecosystems. 
                                <br><br>
                                Another complication that may arise from the thawing of permafrost is the release of mercury into Earth’s oceans and atmosphere. A recent study suggests that all of the mercury that humans have released into the atmosphere in the last 30 years (by coal-burning and other forms of pollution alike) equates to a mere one-tenth of the amount of mercury built-up in the Arctic permafrost. Mercury is a metal that is often found in fish. It has the ability to cause serious health problems in humans if consumed in excessive amounts, including vision deficiencies, speech impairments, and uncontrollable muscle movements. As the permafrost melts, its mercury content can be washed into the ocean or released into the atmosphere—both of which would provide mediums for circulation to different ecosystems, potentially impacting several food webs that extend to regions beyond the Arctic.
                                <br><br> 
                                One of the first countries to experience consequences associated with permafrost thawing is Russia. With nearly 70% of the country’s landmass covered by permafrost, rising temperatures have melted Russia’s roads and formed sizeable bodies of water at incredible speeds. A prominent example of these effects can be seen in In Batagai, Russia (Figure 3), where massive crater (called a slump) has formed. Surprisingly, this depression was not created by a meteorite, but by the melting of the permafrost that previously laid beneath the road. This slump now expands by over 60 feet a year.

                            <h1>Solutions to Peemafrost Thawing</h1>
                        <p>     
                            Minimizing the thawing of permafrost is challenging. One solution may be to reduce our dependence on coal and other fuels that emit greenhouse gases. Interestingly, alternative solutions exist that have nothing to do with fuel at all; instead, they revolve around animals. Russian scientist, Sergei Zimov, began experimenting with animals to introduce the possibility of transforming lands engrossed with forests into grasslands, with the ultimate goal of mimicking the ancient Arctic ecosystem.
                            <br><br>
                            According to Zimov, there are more forests present in the Arctic today than before it was occupied by humans. Millions of animals that once controlled the vegetation have now either died or left the area. When animals trample through Arctic snow, they provide ventilation that better enables the earth to cool in the winter, keeping the permafrost frozen. Zimov states that the soil is 20 degrees warmer in regions without animals when compared to places with just grass and a small variety of animal species. In collaboration with a Russian lab, Zimov has proposed a creative solution: reintroduce the woolly mammoth using DNA samples from 28,000 year old ancestors (Figure 4). The de-extinction procedure would clone the mammoth using advanced DNA technologies, eventually reintroducing the woolly mammoth species to our ecosystems. Because mammoths can trample through snow to break-up and fertilize soil, Zimov believes that their de-extinction could increase grass diversity and density, helping to stabilize the permafrost and prevent it from melting. Zimov continues his research on woolly mammoths, hoping to one day reintroduce the ancient species as a tool to reduce the rate of permafrost thawing.

                    <p>     
                        Permafrost thawing is a major global issue that will affect everyone in every country regardless of their location, economic status, or preparedness. With global temperatures continuing to rise and permafrost continuing to thaw, immediate action must be taken before any more carbon dioxide, methane, or mercury is released from the permafrost in the Arctic. Whether you’re a student, a professor, or a community member, everyone can do their part to limit climate change. After all, the ground beneath us is literally melting.
