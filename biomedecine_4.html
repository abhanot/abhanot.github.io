                            A direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic test is any DNA test for a medical or non-medical trait that provides test results directly to the consumer, without the involvement of a clinical health professional. DTC tests can be purchased on the Internet without the need for a medical referral. These tests can be used to explore genealogy, heritable disease-risk, and much more. Over 12 million people used DNA-testing kits in 2017 alone; if you haven’t yet used one yourself, you probably know someone who has. While DTC testing can be fun, there are risks involved. Here are five things you should know before ordering a DNA-testing kit.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>1. How it Works
                        </h1>
                        <p>     
                            All human DNA is characterized by four chemical building blocks, or nucleotides,  represented by the single letters A, T, G, and C (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine respectively). Your genetic makeup is a specific arrangement of 6 billion of these nucleotides, which together comprise your genome. Using a small sample of saliva, DNA-testing companies search your genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—specific letters in your DNA sequence that are different from the typical reference genome that represents the entire human population. The SNPs determined by DNA-testing companies are genetic variants that could have implications pertaining to your genetic propensity for many things—from having a child with blue eyes to developing early-onset Alzheimer's.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>2. The Different Types of DTC Genetic Testing
                        </h1>
                        <p>     
                            All genetic test kits rely on the same piece of information: your genome. However, different companies look at different parts of your genome, resulting in a free market with a variety of DNA test kit purposes. One of the most well-known DNA-testing services is AncestryDNA, which looks at your genome in comparison to a very large genealogical pool in order to obtain family-tree breakdowns and find ways to connect with biological relatives. 23andMe is also among the most popular DNA-testing kits, and is the only kit to offer health screenings in addition to genealogical DNA testing. Fertilome aims to highlight the presence of genetic markers associated with fertility problems, and helps people choose between such potential solutions as freezing their eggs or trying in vitro fertilization (IVF). Genesight is designed to reveal which psychiatric medications are likely to be most effective for a particular patient. Vinome combines information about your DNA and your personal taste preferences to find a wine that’s perfect for your taste buds. While there is a wide range of companies that look at your genome and analyze its different aspects, it is important to be aware of the information you’ll be receiving as a consumer and be prepared for what the test might reveal.

                        <h1>3. The Current Regulation Policies of DTC Genetic Testing
                        </h1>
                        <p>     
                            The biotechnology industry is developing so quickly that current legislation is struggling to keep up. Most genetic tests today are not regulated, meaning they’re available in the market without any independent analysis to verify each sellers claim. In the United States, where most genetic testing companies are based, the main agencies with authority to regulate genetic testing are the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Genetic and genomic tests are evaluated and regulated using the same criteria as other typical diagnostic tests—using analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. Firstly, analytical validity analyzes how accurately the test can detect whether or not a SNP is present. Secondly, clinical validity looks into how much a genetic variant has been shown to increase the likelihood of getting a particular disease. Lastly, clinical utility addresses whether or not the test can provide information about a disease and how to go about treating and preventing it. These federal agencies only oversee analytical validity, leaving clinical validity and utility to be unregulated.
 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            Dr. Kathleen Hill, a professor at Western University within the Department of Biology, brings to light that consumers have a “lack of informed consent” when they sign up for a DNA test, and that there is a “lack [of] assistance in interpreting test data” for consumers. Sometimes, DTC testing does more harm than good because the consumer is left unequipped, from a knowledgeable and emotional standpoint, to appropriately interpret and act on their test results. For example, a person could have a mutation in the BRCA gene—a typical breast cancer mutation—and receive a negative test result if the variant that they have is not one of the three BRCA mutations that 23andMe tests for. If someone isn’t aware the test is only meaningful for a specific subset of the population, they may wrongly interpret a negative result to mean that they don’t have an increased cancer risk, when in truth, they may. On the other hand, if a person learns they have a BRCA mutation and, in turn, an increased risk of getting breast cancer, they may independently decide to undergo a hasty procedure such as a preventive double mastectomy without any genetic counselling. 
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>     
                        As a consumer, ask yourself the following questions: is it fair of the genetic testing company to distribute this information? Is it ethical to administer a genetic test with low clinical utility? Are consumers entirely aware of what they’re doing when they’re taking a genetic test, or is a high level of scientific literacy required?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>4. Understand the Future Implications of Genetic Testing
                    </h1>
                    <p>     
                        The Genetic Non-Discrimination Act (GNA), formerly known as Bill S-201, was passed into Canadian law as of May 4, 2017. Before this, Canada was the only country in the G7 without laws to protect citizens from genetic discrimination. The GNA protects individuals from being required to disclose genetic test results in areas outside of medical care and medical research, such as insurance and employment. However, if you currently have a genetic disorder the GNA doesn’t prohibit insurers from using information about your condition—even though that condition has a genetic basis. 
                    </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            Genetic testing has significant implications on the entire healthcare industry. Dr. Hill notes that the new wave of uninformed reporting through DTC genetic testing will bring a new perspective into the healthcare system. “Rather than patients coming into a clinic with a referral from a doctor based on a physical symptom, they’re now coming in with DNA data.” Dr. Hill continues to explain how this is “bypassing the expertise of professional assistance from genetic counsellors and trained advocates and educators within the healthcare system.”                            </p>
                        <br>
                       
                    <h1>5. Your DNA can be Used to Contribute to Scientific Developments</h1>
                    <p>     
                        By contributing to genomic databases, your DNA can contribute to research and scientific developments. One way this is done is by research companies outsourcing genomic data from DTC companies to associate SNPs with particular genes and traits. In addition, 23andMe uses their consumer-provided data for research and has already reported preliminary findings  of genetic variants linked to detached earlobes, the risk of Parkinson's disease, and more. 
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            Overall, genetic testing is becoming a larger part of society every day. Your DNA is ultimately the most personal part of you—and if you choose to give it to a DNA-testing company, it’s important to be educated about what you’re signing up for.
