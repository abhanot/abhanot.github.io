                            It’s 2018; $99 and a wad of spit goes a long way. Sending a sample of your saliva to a Silicon Valley startup can lead to a host of new information. Companies like <a href="https://www.23andme.com/en-ca/"><i>23andMe</i></a> and <a href="https://www.ancestry.ca/"><i>Ancestry.ca</i></a> look for specific sequences in the genomes of curious consumers, with requisite information ranging from the breakdown of your ethnicity to your potential risk for Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s disease. The surge in popularity and consumer appeal of ancestral and genomic traits has led to a boom in the “direct-to-consumer” genome-sequencing industry. Analyst expectations on the growth of this industry have been exceeded over the past 5 years, and the industry has ballooned to a valuation of around <a href="https://www.genome.gov/27570940/april-20-directtoconsumer-genomic-testing/">$120 million</a>. The advent of personal genomic technologies is not without criticism; ethical and social concerns have arisen and should be discussed through broad public engagement.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                       
                        <p>
                            Height, sex, and disease-risk are all complex traits known as phenotypes. Your phenotypes are determined by more than 3 billion elements called nucleobases—A, C, T, and G—which comprise your genome. What makes one look, talk and think differently than the other 7.6 billion people in the world are small variations in your nucleotide sequence, packed into every single cell that makes up your body. The cost of genomic sequencing has nosedived in recent years and, with the advent of many breakthroughs, the technology has also become more efficient. Since the inception of the <a href="http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb0008-e.htm">Human Genome Project</a> in 2000, the National Human Genome Research Institute—the primary agency in the US devoted to genetic research—allocates merely <a href="https://www.genome.gov/pages/about/budget/nhgrify2018cj.pdf"> 1-2%</a> of its funding to legal and social issues. This leads us to consider the social, ethical and legal impacts that genetic sequencing will have, both today and for generations to come. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>     
                            Direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies use a highly efficient <a href="https://www.illumina.com/techniques/popular-applications/genotyping.html">genotyping chip</a> that analyzes thousands of mutations. The results can produce personal reports about genes related to certain diseases. But let’s say, for example, that I were to receive a report suggesting that I have a specific mutation in the Apolipoprotein E gene (<i>APOE</i>)—a mutation that was <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5526196/pdf/nihms881333.pdf">recently found</a> to be a strong indicator of a predisposition to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.  How would receiving that report impact me, as a consumer? Of course, I would have questions: If I know my quality of life in the future will be affected by Alzheimer's disease, what can I do to ameliorate that outcome? Should my general outlook on life change knowing that my quality of life will substantially deteriorate as I age? Should I tell my siblings to get tested in case they have this mutation too? The concerns surrounding how genetic test results could impact consumers leads us to question how we can manage such inquiries as a society: What responsibilities do healthcare professionals have to take preventative measures with these patients? What are the rights of the consumer to withhold their genetic test results from life-insurers and governmental agencies?

                            Tom Haffie, a faculty member in Biology at Western University, offers valuable insight regarding the topic at hand. In an interview conducted earlier this year he touched on the future of genetic sequencing: 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <blockquote>
                            “Your health card may have a category related to your exome in the future, and that category may determine how your exome gets interpreted in a healthcare environment.” – Tom Haffie
                        </blockquote>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            An exome is the entire collection of coding sequences in your DNA. At the rate of growth in the industry, Haffie believes that our generation’s children will possibly inherit this technology. The idea that a health card would provide information about our genetic identities gives us insight into a future where genes and mutations could alter our medical care. Industry-disruptive initiatives such as personalized medicine and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/bench-to-bedside&sa=D&ust=1544426934668000&usg=AFQjCNHEfG4bPG_WIV-tVNDYljSC8PDeMg"><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/bench-to-bedside">bench-to-bedside research</a></a> could quickly become reality. The medical applications are endless, but they come with considerable social consequences.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>     
                        In Canada, stringent laws concerning authority and enforcing rules over the wide-ranging uses of genetic tests are not yet in place. As the cost of genetic testing and sequencing decreases, these technologies are expected to play a key role in how we approach healthcare. The results of a direct-to-consumer genetic test could become critical from a medical, social, and financial perspective. Should employers have the ability to refuse investing in someone who is predisposed to developing a genetic disease? Does the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) have the rights to obtain your genetic sequence and mandate preventative care measures against a disease you are at risk of developing? “In a strictly capitalist world, you can’t expect companies to try not to cut their losses by having access to this type of information,” says Haffie, referring to a scenario in which insurance providers could alter their coverage after receiving their customers’ genetic reports. If effective laws are set in place and pre-emptive measures are taken today, the rights of the Canadian citizens can be maintained tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>     
                        In 10 years, the impacts and prominence of genetic sequencing could be life-changing. “We have to be respectful of the risks,” cautions Professor Haffie, “but we don’t want to give up on the advantages”. As the industry grows, so does the potential for early intervention in preventing the progression of genetic diseases. Will your genetic sequence be part of your medical identity? Time will tell, and many will have a say, but the future is enticing.                    
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Canadian government has yet to develop concrete laws and programs that would facilitate the integration of genetic testing into society and the healthcare system. Bill <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/S-201/&sa=D&ust=1544426934669000&usg=AFQjCNGz3ZbZq6fWYBfyK-Azp9tc2z7pVw">S-201</a>, the <i>Genetic Non-Discrimination Act</i>, is currently the only statute pertaining to genetic testing in Canada. The Bill prohibits any individual from being required to undergo genetic testing or release genetic test results as part of any contractual agreement, and prohibits discrimination based on an individual’s genetic makeup. What this statute still fails to recognize is how genetic test results are significant on an individual level: How can direct-to-consumer companies ensure that their customers fully understand their test results? If someone has a predisposition to a genetic disease, should they be obligated to inform their close biological relatives for fear that they may also have the predisposition? Do healthcare professionals need to pre-emptively treat patients to mitigate the onset of a predisposed illness?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Increased government regulation of genetic testing should be met with broad public discourse, and a priority should be set on implementing social programs that outline the outcomes of genetic tests at both the psychosocial and clinical level. More specifically, programs that target medically underserved and diverse populations should aim to educate on the interpretations of genetic tests. Furthermore, how genetic testing will be implemented in the coming years should be addressed through rigorous collaboration between governmental, social and medical institutions.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We are calling on Western students and the London community to encourage <a href="http://pfragiskatos.liberal.ca/">local members of government</a> to further enact specific regulations on direct-to-consumer genetic testing in relation to Bill S-201, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, and to educate the public about the benefits and risks of genetic testing. Understanding the impacts of genetic testing on our lives today is critical to ensuring a sustainable future, wherein genetic testing can have significant medical applications without compromising the psychosocial standards of our society.
