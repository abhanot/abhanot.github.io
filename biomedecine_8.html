                            Do you ever see a piece of gold—perhaps in a jewelry shop, or on your watch—and wonder, “Can I use this to cure cancer?” Unsurprisingly, not many of us do.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/materials-science/nanomaterials/gold-nanoparticles.html">Gold’s practicality shines in the field of nanotechnology</a>, which deals with the manipulation of particles that could be as small as one billionth of a meter.  Through movies and television shows, elements of mainstream media have convinced us that nanotechnology resembles something straight out of a sci-fi movie—after all, how can scientists accurately manipulate particles like gold at such a small scale and then use them to treat diseases?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            The exciting prospect of nanotechnology is its powerful ability to specifically target certain cells and proteins. Essentially, it makes drug delivery more accurate. To better understand how nanotechnology works, we’ll start by looking at the chemical delivery process that occurs when one ingests a pill.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>DRUG DELIVERY</h1>
                        <p>     
                        When we take pills, we often do so with the expectation that we’ll suddenly get better a few hours later, but how these pills actually work remains a mystery to a large proportion of the public. To understand most drugs, we need to understand enzymes. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                            Enzymes are biological catalysts that basically kickstart chemical reactions in our body; they play an important role in converting certain stimuli into the pain that we feel. Consider your body’s response to pricking a finger on something sharp: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430162/pdf/brjclinpharm00214-0023.pdf">As outlined in a 1980 issue of the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</a>, upon pricking your finger, your cells release a chemical called arachidonic acid. Molecules of this acid bind to certain enzymes, which then go on to cause pain. As it turns out, Aspirin, the pain tablet, binds to these enzymes faster and more efficiently than the arachidonic acid, essentially taking its place. Concisely, if fewer enzymes are bound to the acid,  you will feel less pain. This is one mechanism by which drugs commonly work to reduce the clinical manifestations of many conditions. Numerous types of drugs are designed in this manner or by a similar mechanism that is also oriented around the structure of the molecules involved. 
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL CANCER THERAPY</h1>
                    <p>     
                            So who needs nanotechnology when we can just inject chemicals into the body and have them bind to whatever we choose? Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Drug specificity is an obstacle that is often difficult to overcome. Chemicals do not typically just bind to whatever we want them to. Many drugs bind to things other than what they’re meant for, so when we take medication, we often experience side effects.                        
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                                A normal tablet of Aspirin can be orally ingested to treat pain or inflammation at any location on the body, as well as to provide relief from a fever. The drug’s lack of specificity allows it to act in a delocalized manner, but this isn’t particularly concerning. It’s okay if a tablet as mild as Aspirin acts in more ways than just what it was taken for, but that’s not the case for more toxic medications. Many drugs used to treat more severe conditions such as cancer  would have extremely adverse effects if they were to target every part of the body. Cancer therapies typically rely on some potent drugs, such as Taxol, which can kill any rapidly-dividing cell. For this reason, an aggressive cancer treatment not only kills cancer cells, but healthy cells as well. This is why chemotherapy can be so debilitating for its patients.                        
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                                To avoid killing healthy, non-cancerous cells, scientists must design drugs that are specific to cancer cells—a task that sounds simple enough, but is incredibly challenging in reality. All cancers are different, which complicates things considerably, but what’s more of an issue is that cancer cells are really just our own cells that have lost control. To beat cancer with drugs, scientists must design medicine that can distinguish our own cells… from our own cells.                        
                            </p>
                            <br>
                    <h1>A FUTURE WITH GOLD</h1>
                    <p>     
                            Nanoparticles made of gold, known as colloidal gold (Figure 1), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3473940/">may hold the answers to this dilemma</a>. Nanoparticles containing drugs will only release these chemicals when they come into contact with specific targets. Drugs similar to Taxol could theoretically become associated with these nanoparticles, which would allow such drugs to target specific cancer cells instead of indiscriminately attacking every cell encountered throughout the body                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                                This approach, despite being effective, is not enough. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.2890">Statistically speaking</a>, it’s likely that some of the cancer cells will survive chemotherapy. These residual cells will continue to multiply to produce an even more aggressive, drug-resistant tumor—and if the mass metastasizes, a patient could be left with resistant cancer cells in numerous locations across the body. Gold, however, may hold the solution to this problem: thermal therapy.                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849375/">Thermal therapy</a> relies on the principle that metals absorb heat at a much faster rate than organic matter, such as cells. When a healthcare professional directs radiation at the region of interest (i.e., the expected location of the cancer), the increased absorption of heat by the nanoparticles associated with the cancerous cells causes those cells to heat up and die, while healthy, nanoparticle-free cells survive.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     
                                The use of gold nanoparticles for drug delivery and thermal therapy may be effective in treating a variety of cancers. A <a href="http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/5/4/1014.long">2006 study</a> involving breast cancer in mice showed a tenfold reduction in tumour cell survival after just 18 hours of combined treatment (nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery followed by thermal therapy). Similar results from <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961212005881?via=ihub#sec4">a study conducted in 2012</a> showcase a <a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0142961212005881-gr5.jpg">significant reduction</a> in tumor weight and volume when gold nanoparticles were used for drug delivery and radiation therapy.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>     
                                    The field of nanotechnology is growing at an <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/single-view-sc-policy/news/nanotechnology_is_a_growing_research_priority/">astoundingly fast pace</a>. Nanoparticle-bound drugs are already being assessed in clinical trials—that is, some of them are already being used to treat humans. <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02124317?term=nanoparticle&recrs=abcd&cond=Cancer&rank=1">Albumin-bound Taxol, for example, is being administered to trial subjects with pancreatic cancer in China</a>. Nanotechnology is on the rise, with a promise for more clinical trials looming in the near future. As modern technology continues to rapidly evolve, the future of healthcare treads into an uncharted territory full of exciting possibilities. So, the next time you see a piece of gold, ask yourself if that shiny piece of metal might one day be used to save your life, or the lives of millions down the road.
