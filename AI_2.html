                                The year is 2018; we’re three years removed from Back to the Future’s vision of the future and flying cars are nowhere to be seen. Automated cars, however, could be right around the corner.
                                <br><br>
                                Automated cars, more commonly referred to as automated vehicles, are one of the hottest topics in Silicon Valley. Auto-industry giants Ford, GM, and Tesla, along with tech-industry titans such as Google and Uber, have invested billions of dollars in developing their own automated technology programs. 
                                <br><br>
                                Given the meteoric growth of the industry in recent years, the world’s top automakers predict that fully-automated vehicles could be ready for roads within the next decade. In fact, partially-automated vehicles are already commercially available today. A vehicle’s level of automation is classified on a scale from 0 to 5; each successive level cedes further responsibility from the driver to the car. Level 1 and 2 vehicles are equipped with automated braking systems and lane-keeping technology, respectively; these are the vehicles available for purchase today. Level 3 vehicles utilize more autonomous functions than previous levels; however, they still require the presence of a driver behind the wheel. Level 4 and 5 vehicles are driverless; the former are limited to a subset of driving scenarios whereas the latter are truly equipped for all driving conditions. Waymo, an industry leader, has already developed Level 4 automated vehicles—you can find them driving themselves around Phoenix, Arizona.
                                <br><br>
                                But how exactly do these vehicles work? Automated vehicles incorporate a variety of tools such as cameras, sensors, radar and LIDAR—a laser system that measures object distance based on pulses and reflections of light—to collect data about the surrounding environment. A central computer then uses the data to make real-time decisions regarding the steering and acceleration of the vehicle via machine-learning techniques such as neural networks. Neural networks analyze vast amounts of data to discern patterns, which are subsequently used to ‘teach’ cars how to steer or recognize objects on the road.
                                <br><br>
                                With the introduction of fully-automated vehicles just around the corner, it’s important to consider the benefits and consequences of having this technology on the road. Do automated vehicles hold the potential to improve the future of driving? Can they thrive where human drivers falter, effectively reducing congestion, increasing fuel economy, and improving public safety? Here’s what you need to know.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                                <h1>CONGESTION</h1>
                                
                        <p>
                                Do you ever wonder why traffic jams can form for seemingly no reason at all? No accidents, no lane closures—and yet, a sudden stoppage of all the cars on the road. You’ve probably experienced this phenomenon, known as a phantom traffic jam.
                                <br><br>
                                Phantom traffic jams occur when a car drives too closely to the car in front of it, or changes lanes too aggressively. Both cases necessitate sudden braking in order to avoid an accident. Braking, even just a little, will force other cars to brake as well, setting off a domino effect that causes every vehicle in the affected lane to slow down. This is how just a single car can impede the flow of traffic, and where automated technology could prove useful.

                                <h3>Pros</h3>
                                
                        <p>
                                Technologies such as automated cruise control offer solutions to alleviate phantom traffic jams. Automated cruise control uses sensors to determine the location and traveling speed of an automated vehicle relative to the vehicle in front of it. The technology then uses this information to maintain a minimum distance between vehicles. It allows cars to continue traveling at high speeds while optimizing inter-vehicle distances to minimize braking, creating more efficient traffic flow.
                                <br><br>
                                Human drivers can benefit from automated vehicles on the road, as well. A recent study found that self-driving cars can influence nearby human drivers to adopt better driving practices.
                                <br><br>
                                Through a series of traffic simulations, researchers showed that just one automated vehicle can influence at least 20 human-driven cars around it, substantially reducing speed deviation and overall excessive braking.
                                <br><br>
                                Another study created a virtual traffic model based on data collected from the city of Boston. This study suggests that in the future, automated vehicles may partially replace personal vehicles. A shift towards the use of automated vehicles—particularly those that are shared, such as automated taxis and minibuses—is expected to reduce average travel time by 4.3% in the city of Boston as a whole, due to an overall reduction in the number of vehicles on the road. It should be noted, however, that this figure includes a predicted reduction in shared-transportation use—and therefore an increase in average travel time—in the city’s downtown core. The net influence of automation on the use of shared-transportation is a critical determinant of overall congestion. Although automated cars might outperform human-driven cars on a one-to-one basis, the ability of automated technology to reduce congestion ultimately boils down to maintaining high levels of shared-transportation usage.

                                In the future, automated vehicles may be incorporated into rideshare systems such as Uber or Lyft. Self-driving cars can substantially reduce operating costs for these companies by eliminating the need for drivers.  As rideshare services become more affordable, we may see more people than ever before choosing on-demand mobility as their preferred method of everyday transportation.
                                <br><br>
                                If the costs between public transit options and automated vehicles become similar, people may be inclined to forgo public transit in favour of hailing their own private vehicles. The allure is tempting—private automated vehicles offer passengers a sense of privacy and comfort absent in public transit. However, a decrease in public transit use in favour of single-passenger cars is concerning in terms of urban congestion. 
                                <br><br>
                                Similarly, zero-passenger vehicles pose an even larger problem. The affordability of automation presents the opportunity for people to run errands, such as picking up dry-cleaning or delivering mail, without being physically present. These vehicles would contribute to congestion by clogging roads throughout the day.
                                <br><br>
                                Whether or not there is a net reduction in congestion depends on two forces at play: the number of vehicles on the road, and the efficiency with which those vehicles operate. If automated vehicles are used to replace single-passenger personal vehicles, the introduction of more efficient driving is predicted to create smoother traffic flow and reduce congestion. If these vehicles are used as alternatives to public transit, the sheer number of cars on the road will outweigh all and any efficient driving brought forth by automation, resulting in a net increase in congestion. The implementation of regulatory policies such as toll fees or single/zero-passenger fees—which discourage the overuse of low-occupancy vehicles—will play an important role in determining the impact that automation has on congestion.

                                In 2015, vehicles accounted for 24% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Although vehicles are an essential part of everyday life, with rising global temperatures, it’s important to explore methods of reducing their emissions. Automation offers a unique solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by making vehicles more fuel-efficient and eco-friendly.
                        </p>
                                <br><br>

                                Did you know that drivers can save around 10% more gas by following eco-driving principles? Eco-driving principles include gentle acceleration and braking, which consume less energy than sudden stops and starts. Unfortunately, humans rarely take full advantage of these driving principles, wasting gas that could otherwise be saved. Automated vehicles are able to automatically adjust their driving speeds to maintain steady distances from other vehicles, producing smoother, more controlled movements that conserve gas.
                                <br><br>
                                Automated cruise control also enables automated vehicles to take advantage of platooning. Platooning refers to the mechanism by which vehicles can enter a tight and aerodynamic formation through the maintenance of steady, but close, inter-vehicle distances. By reducing the air resistance faced by each car, platooning allows vehicles to reduce both energy expenditure and greenhouse gas emissions.

                        <p>
                                Although automated vehicles may be able to take full advantage of eco-driving principles, the technology behind the driving requires energy to use. The radars, sensors, and central processing core all consume varying amounts of electricity. While automation may allow for more energy-efficient driving, these vehicles would still indirectly contribute to greenhouse emissions.
                                <br><br>
                                Sensor technology can also contribute to increasing the amount of drag that a vehicle experiences. Depending on its size, a sensor system—such as the LIDAR system—installed on the outside of a car can contribute to various amounts of aerodynamic drag. These technologies can also weigh vehicles down, producing a requirement for more energy (gas) to move cars from one place to another.
                                <br><br>
                                The biggest potential increase in emissions comes from having more cars on the road. As previously discussed, depending on how many people choose personal automated vehicles over public transit, emissions could either drop or increase dramatically. 
                                <br><br>
                                The potential for automated vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions comes down to a series of tradeoffs. A variety of factors such as driving efficiency, vehicle design, and shared-transportation usage all impact the ability of automation to reduce emissions. This reduction is estimated to fall between 40-60%, with the greatest effector being the abandonment of personal vehicles in favour of adopting ride-sharing practices. However, promoting the adoption of these practices may be tough; people may not be inclined to give up the numerous benefits of travelling independently, and policymakers must work to incentivize a mass shift towards shared transportation to make this dream a reality.

                                In 2016, 160 000 Canadians were injured from vehicle collisions. The development of self-driving cars poses a burning question: how many of these accidents can be prevented?

                                The U.S. Department of Transportation has attributed 94% of car crashes to human error. Automated vehicles drive free of alcohol, distraction or fatigue—factors which are estimated to be responsible for 28%, 2% and 9% of fatal crashes respectively. With no humans behind the wheel, automation may have the potential to reduce the annual amount of car crashes. In fact, the state of California—in which there are 55 companies with testing permits for self-driving cars—has reported ~90 crashes involving self-driving cars since 2014. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles found that most of these accidents were not caused by automated vehicles, but by humans.

                                Automation itself is still far from perfect. Last April, a Level 3 autonomous vehicle belonging to Uber fatally struck a woman who was crossing a street. The car was running in autonomous driving mode, under the supervision of a backup driver, and its perception system had failed to detect the woman until after she’d been struck. Although the backup driver—who is responsible for intervening in such situations—had been distracted watching a television show, the failure of the technology is concerning nonetheless. Could this accident have been avoided if a human had been behind the wheel, focused on the road? Incidents like these contribute to an ongoing debate about the safety of automation and whether automated vehicles are truly safer than human drivers.

                                Lacking human judgment, automated technologies also face the challenge of interpreting human behaviour. For example, at a crosswalk, how would an automated vehicle decide who has the right of way? In these situations, social cues like eye contact and hand gestures between vehicles and pedestrians are key for maintaining proper communication.

                                Automated vehicles use machine-learning techniques such as neural networking to learn driving habits and identify surrounding objects. Not only do these programs have to identify humans; they also have to identify their intent. How will automated technologies distinguish pedestrians waiting for buses from those who are about to jaywalk? How will they differentiate a pedestrian from a police officer directing traffic? In the wake of publicized crashes involving automated vehicles, these are important questions to answer.
                                <br><br>
                                The implementation of vehicle-to-pedestrian communication platforms offers a potential solution for automated vehicles to signal their intent to other cars and pedestrians. Examples include using flashing LED lights to instruct pedestrians to cross the street, or sending notifications to pedestrians via smartphone to inform them about how the vehicle intends to move. How willing people would be to participate in these platforms is another question entirely.
                                <br><br>
                                Thus far, Waymo’s automated vehicles have self-driven a combined total of 10 million miles on public roads. Although the company has racked up more autonomous miles than any other, a mere 10 million miles of test-driving pales compared to the billions of miles driven by humans collectively. Manufacturers face a variety of challenges in ensuring that their vehicles are safe and ready for the road. While more testing is required to conclusively determine the safety of automated technology, a careful balance must be maintained between prioritizing realistic testing conditions and ensuring public safety.

                                The ability of automated vehicles to improve driving in areas of urban congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote public safety are crucial in determining whether automation holds a place in society’s future. The effects of automation on congestion and greenhouse gas emissions are largely dependent upon the implementation of policies that promote a shift toward shared-transportation use. Further, it’s important to remember that in order to improve public safety, automated vehicles don’t have to be perfect; they need only outperform humans to reduce the incidence of vehicle-related injuries. Crashes happen—it’s the harsh reality, regardless of who’s driving the car—but delaying the development and release of safe-but-not-perfect automated vehicles may lead to more annual road deaths than are necessary.

                                Legislation governing the use of automated vehicles can take years to pass, and Canada has made little progress compared to such other countries as the United States, who recently unveiled a $100 million investment into automated vehicles—$60 million of which, will be put towards assessing the feasibility and safety of self-driving cars. Policymakers will need to put in place the appropriate legislation to support automation. Although there remains work to be done before automated vehicles can optimize driving, we can likely expect to observe a global shift towards automation in the years to come.
